## ⭐ Tips to make this profile better
1. **Pin 4–6 best repos** (the ones that show real work, README, screenshots).  
2. **Add screenshots or GIFs** to each project repo — immediate impact for visitors.  
3. **Write project READMEs** with: demo, tech, setup steps, and small architecture notes.  
4. **Add a clean profile photo** and a short bio (1 line) on your profile.  
5. **Contribute to open-source** or fix small issues in popular repos — good for visibility.  
6. **Use Issues/PRs to document learning** (e.g., "fix: improve accessibility for X").  
7. **Use GitHub Actions** for CI or to auto-generate project pages (optional).  
8. **Keep commits readable**; meaningful commit messages look professional.
